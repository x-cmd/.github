## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Happy to be part of the Renaissance of command line.

👩‍💻 Always welcome to get update from https://x-cmd.com.

🍿 From the original idea to X-CMD: typescript(prototype) => go(almost finished) => bash => shawk(shell + awk, Big Bang! Then two years of misery.)

🍿 Fun facts - I was inspired by staring Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet while queuing at the cinema. 

🧙 YES. X-CMD is your infinite guantlet. The power of it comes from the GREATE open source tools. 

🧙 This tool can also be your mighty hammer. It can be your powerful Excalibur over the cloud. Let's use it for the peace and goodness.

🧙 This is the way.
